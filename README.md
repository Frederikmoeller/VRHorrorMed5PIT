DUE TO THE PROJECT BEING TO BIG IT HAS BEEN UPLOADED WITH THE REPORT ITSELF AS A ZIPFILE

VR horror game
PIT Miniproject
By Frederik Møller (Group 5)

Goal of the project:
The project aims to create an immersive VR horror experience on a mountaintop. The player needs to feel disoriented and lost in the game while not being clunky to play. The player needs to be able to interact with the environment by picking up stuff and feel haptic feedback when done.

What does the project consist of:
The project consists of many parts. The most important parts are the volumetric fog and lights, the VR components, and the terrain.
Furthermore, many 3D assets litter the ground, making it seem like a forest on a mountain.
There are also many materials used to make the world seem real and give textures to the terrain and 3D models.
A procedural terrain painter package was used from the asset store to paint the terrain quickly.
In the game, you can move the player using the left joystick on the quest controller and drive around in your playspace.
Two hand models have been implemented to simulate your hand and immerse the player. The hand models also give anchor points to the grab interactor so it knows where to place the item.
When the player grabs or lets go of an item, the controller that picked it up will give the user haptic feedback as a slight vibration.

Requirements to use:
It is made in Unity 2022.3.4f, and using that version of Unity is recommended. Furthermore, different asset packs and packages might be needed to run the game. These can be found in the external resources section.
Also, there might be an issue with the hut models not being sent.
Otherwise, the game will run on a decent PC via a link connection to Quest 2.
The game should also work on the Quest 3 and pro versions, but this has not been tested.


Timetable:
The time used to create the different parts of the project can be seen below:

Terrain (3 hours)
Volumetric fog and lights (10 hours)
3D modeling (1 hour)
Terrain textures (3 hours)
Realise project doesn’t work in VR (4 hours)
Porting everything to a VR Template (5 hours)
implementing VR (4 hours)
Tactile feedback (5 min)
These times are rough estimates but should be representative.
External Resources:
The game uses a lot of external resources in terms of packages. Underneath here are all the packages used from the asset store:


Used for 3D terrain models.


Used for different brushes to create terrain.


Used for the flashlight light

Used for creating a dense fog


Used for Skybox


Used for quick terrain painting

Furthermore, tutorials from the Moodle page have been used to create VR interactions such as grabbing and sockets.


Future work:
To complete the project, the product needs a ton of work. The first thing is to make the objective count towards an end goal. Then, after that, sounds can be implemented, and the enemy can be implemented with behaviour that threatens the player.
The last thing to implement is a sprint option. This is more of a quality of life, making the game go by faster.
Another thing that might need to be implemented is a way to guide the player around the map so they know where to go and they do not get stuck.
An example of this would be a death barrier if the player falls into the ravine in the middle of the map.

The game could become a fully-fledged, scary experience with these last implementations.
